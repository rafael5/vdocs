"""Shared markdown-structure primitives — the single home (§9.2/§11 anti-duplication).

Headings, code fences, blank-line runs, and tag stripping are parsed by `normalize`, `anchors`,
`template`, and `discover` alike. Their regexes and the fence-aware heading-scan loop lived
copy-pasted across those four modules (heading/fence parse 4–5×); they live here exactly once.

The canonical heading regex is ``#+`` (not ``#{1,6}``): upstream (Pandoc/`convert`) emits >6-``#``
headings from deep DOCX outline levels (e.g. ``########### Table of Contents``), and **every**
caller must recognize them consistently — leaving an invalid >6 ATX heading (GitHub renders it as
literal text) is the bug the ``e1e3b44`` legacy-TOC fix closed. This module makes that resolution
uniform across all four call sites. Pure: strings in, plain values out.
